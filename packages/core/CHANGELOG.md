# @charivo/core

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 8f7d277: Expose inputAudioTranscription on RealtimeSessionConfig (model + enabled)

  `RealtimeSessionConfig` now accepts an optional `inputAudioTranscription` field for controlling user-microphone transcription on the provider:
  - `inputAudioTranscription: { model: "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe" }` selects a cheaper transcription model.
  - `inputAudioTranscription: { model: "gpt-4o-transcribe" }` selects the higher-quality option.
  - `inputAudioTranscription: { enabled: false }` disables transcription entirely (useful when the UI never displays the user transcript).

  Default behavior is unchanged when the field is unset — providers continue with their existing server-side defaults. The wire shape lands under `audio.input.transcription` per the OpenAI Realtime GA contract, and applies consistently across the legacy OpenAI WebRTC client, the OpenAI Agents SDK transport, and the server provider. Model strings are pass-through; unknown values surface as upstream errors from OpenAI rather than being validated locally. Example known values: `whisper-1`, `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-transcribe`.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 8826f2b: Make `@charivo/realtime` session-aware and drop library-owned OpenAI defaults.

  Breaking changes:
  - `buildRealtimeSessionConfig()` no longer fills `provider` or `model`. Pass
    them explicitly on `startSession(...)` or rely on your transport client's
    local defaults.
  - `RealtimeState.session.config.provider` / `.model` may now be `undefined`
    if the caller did not specify them.

  Additive:
  - new `sessionId` threaded through `RealtimeLogger` context and `realtime:usage`
    payloads. Same id persists across `updateSession(...)` and reconnects within
    the same session.
  - logger contexts now include the active `sessionId`. If your logger already
    sets a `sessionId` field, the manager overrides it.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 79df4cc: Make `@charivo/realtime` renderer-neutral by moving avatar-specific realtime
  tools into the new optional `@charivo/realtime-avatar` package.

  Add `RealtimeManager` result projectors and structured logger hooks, and emit
  the new `realtime:usage` core event when transport usage metadata is available.

  Breaking changes:
  - avatar tool helpers are no longer exported from `@charivo/realtime`
  - apps should import avatar realtime helpers from `@charivo/realtime-avatar`
  - avatar expression/motion/gaze events now come from configured result
    projectors rather than hardcoded tool-name handling inside `RealtimeManager`

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d6608f: Freeze the top-level Charivo API by adding symmetric `detachLLM()` /
  `detachRenderer()` coverage plus `dispose()`, and normalize public failures to
  typed `CharivoError` subclasses.

  Breaking change: public throws now use typed errors from `@charivo/core`
  instead of relying on generic `Error` strings. Consumers should switch from
  `error.message.includes(...)` checks to `instanceof CharivoError` or
  `error.code`.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 3aa84ad: Improve mobile realtime resilience by adding reconnect orchestration, reconnect
  observability events, direct microphone ownership with safer browser
  constraints, and iOS-friendly audio preparation hooks.

  `@charivo/render-live2d` now handles WebGL context loss by rebuilding the host
  and reloading the last model after restore. `@charivo/stt` now requests
  browser-safe microphone constraints by default.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- c2e1cb8: Add canonical avatar control support with expression, motion, and gaze events/tools, and remove the legacy emotion-based avatar control surface.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ec19d59: Add an OpenAI Agents SDK based realtime client, switch the default remote
  OpenAI WebRTC adapter to the new agents path, and extend realtime session
  bootstrap contracts to support ephemeral client secrets alongside legacy SDP
  bootstraps.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 18fd6e4: Add explicit realtime session refresh support through `updateSession(...)`,
  including reconnect-based config updates, refresh reasons on session lifecycle
  events, and manager reuse across refresh and recovery flows.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- ba07abf: Add a manager-owned realtime tool registry with normalized tool handler types,
  tool timeout and failure handling, manager-side built-in `setEmotion`
  post-processing, and transport-level `sendToolResult(...)` support for
  provider-specific realtime clients.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d773cca: Introduce a provider-agnostic realtime foundation with normalized core types,
  stateful realtime manager APIs, an adapter-dispatched
  `realtime-client-remote` package, and a new
  `realtime-provider-openai` server package.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ca98036: Add explicit TTS player playback capabilities so `tts-core` can prefer
  `playbackMode` and `audioMimeType` over implicit detection. This also removes
  the old constructor-name and mime helper exports from `@charivo/tts-core`, so
  player implementations should declare their playback behavior explicitly.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f9a342: Tighten the public core contracts around the event bus, render manager integration,
  and realtime session configuration. This release also republishes the affected
  public packages with corrected exports, type entrypoints, and package metadata so
  the published artifacts match the validated workspace builds.

  Additional fixes include end-to-end STT `language` forwarding for the remote flow,
  cleanup and lifecycle fixes in the web demo wiring, lower log noise in several
  packages, and improved Live2D package compatibility for bundled app builds.
